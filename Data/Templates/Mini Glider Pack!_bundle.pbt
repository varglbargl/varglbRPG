    Description: "Varglbargl\'s back with a pack of fully scripted equippable mini gliders! Just equip a gilder and jump twice to activate! Perfect for open world and exploration in any setting.\r\n\r\nThis pack includes:\r\n - Seven (7) mini gliders for SciFi, Military, Fantasy and more!\r\n - A scripted wind zone trigger for creating updrafts or gusts of wind you can ride with your glider!\r\n - An optional script for your game to auto-equip gliders to players when they join!\r\n - Instructions for how to fully customize your own mini glider!\r\n\r\nHit me up on the Core Creator Discord if you have any questions (or find any bugs!) <3\r\n\r\nupdate 1.17\r\n - NEW GLIDER: Mini Glider (Sweet), shaped like giant smores with fire trails\r\n - Fixed bug where SOME audio objects would continue to play after you landed when used as the looping glide sfx\r\n\r\nupdate 1.16\r\n - Refactored to not use any Folders inside the equipment objects.\r\n - Nobody ever told to me that was bad, okay!? Sorry! Jeez!\r\n\r\nupdate 1.12-1.15\r\n - Fixed bug where the Air glider sound effects were not playing\r\n - Added IK Anchors to all gliders! Most noticably, you now hold onto the \"Air\" glider correctly!\r\n\r\nupdate 1.10\r\n - Gliders now broadcast Events and set both clientUserData and serverUserData you can hook other scripts into\r\n - See the Glider Readme for more info :)\r\n - Fixed bug where I accidentally deleted the entire \"Air\" glider. At least I hope that was me and not the Manticore Legal Department.\r\n\r\nupdate 1.6:\r\n - Glide is now an Ability that prevents other abilities so it\'s easier to make sure players don\'t break out of\r\n - Refactored code to be much more reliable at syncing glider state between server and client\r\n - Fixed bug where you would get stuck with your arms in the air if using a weapon with no animation stance set"
