-- This Birb includes four (4) built in options that can be
-- switched on and off separately with the checkboxes in the
-- template root's properties (all on by default) that will
-- change your Birb's randomized behavior.

-- Here's what those options will cause your Birb to do:

-- Peck : Occasionally peck the ground in front of it
-- Hop  : Occasionally hop up and down in place a few times
-- Look : Occasionally peek its head side to side
-- Chirp: Occasionally open its beak and make a chirping sound effect

-- For more detailed settings the Animation Controller includes
-- ChirpSound for changing the sound effect that is played during the
-- Chirp animation (ANY audio object will work) and AnimationFrequency
-- for changing roughly how often one of the 4 animations will play.

-- This Birb can be edited into many other types of bird by
-- just editing the colors and the chirp sound. Core has loads of
-- different bird sounds build in so play around a little!

if "you" == "like this Birb" and "you" == "cool" then
  youShould = "gimme a like in the CC!"
end

-- and as always TRANS RIGHTS!
