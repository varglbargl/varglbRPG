• Some buildings \ rooms elements are hidden, it's allows to easy understand what each room or building contains. To make all objects visible just set visibility of "Invisible Walls" group to "Force On". This group is part of "Room" merged model.
• If you want to use only interior, just delete "Room" group.
• You can use this interiors as is or you can easily change atmosphere just by adjusting lights sourches, sounds and VFXs.
• You also can make your own interior design just by copy different parts and combine them.
• Try to combine different interiors! For example add storage to shop or house.
