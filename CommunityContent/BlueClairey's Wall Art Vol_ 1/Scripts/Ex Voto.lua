--[[“May my enemies become my friends, and, if that is possible, may any attempt against me never harm me. 
Make me and all my works invulnerable. So be it. … Saint Rita of Cascia, saint of impossible and desperate cases, 
thank you for all the powerful, decisive, marvelous aide that you have granted me up to now. 
Thank you infinitely. Even if I am personally unworthy of it, 
grant me your aide again and always in my art and always protect everything that I have created
so that even in spite of myself it should always be of great beauty.”
—Yves Klein, excerpt from “Prayer to Saint Rita,” a handwritten document placed within the votive, February 1961 ]]
